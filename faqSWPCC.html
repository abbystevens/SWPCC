                                We are open Monday through Friday, with a school year running from September through June. Families choose both how many days and which days they want their child to attend, assuming spaces are available. Most three year olds attend two or three days and most four year olds attend three or four days. Our four year olds get preference in scheduling and may enroll for four days. Regardless of the number of days a child is enrolled, each child’s parent helps in the classroom once a week.

                                Our school day runs from 9:05am until 1pm. During this time children experience a wide variety of activity choices, participate in group time, eat snack and lunch, and spend an hour playing outside. Our group time includes music and movement, stories, and active discussion. Outside, children can ride tricycles, crawl around our play structure, wave streamers, blow bubbles, or play in the sandbox. The four hour time span allows us to do more in-depth projects such as making applesauce: the children bring in apples, peel and chop them, mash them through a strainer once they are cooked, and enjoy applesauce the same day during lunch.

                               For the 2013-2014 school year, our tuition is $103/month x the number of days per week your child is there without a shift parent on duty. So, if your child were enrolled three days a week — for example, Monday, Wednesday, Friday — your tuition each month would be $206 because one of those three days would be a shift day (2 x $103 = $206). The tuition rate for next year is voted on by the membership at the spring general meeting

                                The Preschool class has a ratio of at least one to four. Our class size is limited to 16 children and each day we have a teacher and three parent helpers.
                                <br>The Young Toddler and Toddler rooms have a teacher/student ratio of at least one to three. Most children attend two or three days a week.
                                <br>We believe that for a large group of children to have a positive preschool experience they need to have sufficient adult guidance. Because of our high ratio we offer activities that require more supervision such as making pretzels, examining worms, and using hotplates to melt crayons on tin foil. It also allows us to intervene in conflicts before they escalate. We take the time to help the children think of and execute solutions on their own. Our parent helpers do not sit on the sidelines, they sit on the floor, at the texture table, or wherever the children are engaged.

                                We believe that having each family commit to being in the classroom once a week is fundamental to our success. Several benefits result from being in the classroom once a week.<br> 
                                <br>
                                - Our teachers develop a true partnership with parents.<br> 
                                - Our children develop relationships with the different parents they play with each week.<br>
                                - Our parents develop friendships and have the opportunity to observe various parenting and teaching approaches the teachers and other parents use.<br> 
                                - It allows for a high adult to child ratio and the ability to offer activities we would not be able to do otherwise.
                                <br>We really believe we are providing our children with the best preschool experience possible and parents’ weekly time in the classroom is a big part of that success.

                                No. Regardless of the number of children you have at Co-op, your family only works one shift day per week. Because we offer one of Portland’s only programs for young toddlers (12-24 months), our school is particularly well suited to families with several young children. For families with multiple children attending Co-op, that one day per week rotates through each child’s classroom. So, for instance, if you have a toddler and a preschooler, your shift day will be in the Toddler Room one week, then in the Preschool Room the next week.

                                We follow the Portland Public Schools’ cut-off. Children who turn three by September 1 may enroll as first year preschoolers; children who turn four by September 1 are second year preschoolers. We have separate young toddler (one by September 1) and toddler (two by September 1) classrooms with lower teacher/parent-to-child ratios (3:7 for young toddlers and 3:9 for toddlers).
                                <br><br>
                                The fact that we have three different classrooms benefits our preschool in several ways. Many families have children in our school for six or more continuous years so our school is filled with families who have spent years together and who are very familiar with the procedures and educational philosophy. This builds a sense of community among families and a more efficient running of the school. The multi-age community provides rich experiences for all age groups.

                                We meet the standards set by the Children’s Environmental Health Network, www.cehn.org, for a child care provider that is friendly to the environment and healthy for children. Some of our practices include: using only non-toxic art supplies; eliminating all smoking, engine idling, pesticides, aerosol sprays, and scented air fresheners; avoiding the use of chemical cleansers; ensuring no exposure to lead or mercury; and using organic gardening practices in our community garden plot.

                                SWPCC’s goal is to keep our children as safe as possible and to make our teachers, parents and students aware of food-allergic children’s allergies and their consequences. Our policy is designed to reduce the chance of severe allergic reactions of children and adults with known food allergies while at Co-op.

                                We have a comprehensive allergy policy that includes teacher, parent, and child education regarding allergies, symptoms, and emergency responses. We do not allow food sharing during Co-op hours between children, teachers, and shift workers. We clean all surfaces where food is prepared and/or consumed prior to and after use. We wash children’s hands before eating, and have hands and faces wiped after eating food. We also require that parents of children with food allergies complete an “Allergy Action Plan”, which specifies symptoms of, and actions for, allergic reaction.

                                General fundraising goals are set for each family to reach the collective goal. These are achieved through several fun and easy fundraising events and ongoing opportunities throughout the year. However, each family’s fundraising is not formally tracked by the school. We choose fundraisers that involve items many people would otherwise spend money on. Examples are the Chinook Book, SCRIP (gift cards to grocery and other stores), special dinners at neighborhood restaurants, and a very simple and elegant silent auction for adults only. Our largest fundraiser is a holiday wreath sale, again, something many people would ordinarily buy.
