                                We are open Monday through Friday, with a school year running from September through June. Families choose both how many days and which days they want their child to attend, assuming spaces are available. Most three year olds attend two or three days and most four year olds attend three or four days. Our four year olds get preference in scheduling and may enroll for four days. Regardless of the number of days a child is enrolled, each child’s parent helps in the classroom once a week.

                                Our school day runs from 9:05am until 1pm. During this time children experience a wide variety of activity choices, participate in group time, eat snack and lunch, and spend an hour playing outside. Our group time includes music and movement, stories, and active discussion. Outside, children can ride tricycles, crawl around our play structure, wave streamers, blow bubbles, or play in the sandbox. The four hour time span allows us to do more in-depth projects such as making applesauce: the children bring in apples, peel and chop them, mash them through a strainer once they are cooked, and enjoy applesauce the same day during lunch.

                               As with most co-ops there is tuition, but families are not billed for the days they work a shift. For the 2013-2014 school year, our tuition is $103/month x the number of days per week your child is there without parent or guardian on shift. So, if your child were enrolled three days a week — for example, Monday, Wednesday, Friday — your tuition each month would be $206 because one of those three days would be a shift day (2 x $103 = $206). The tuition rate for the following academic year is voted on by the membership at the spring general meeting.

                                Our school has been bringing together families for over 40 years and we believe that having each family commit to being in the classroom once a week is fundamental to our success in enriching both children and parents. Several benefits result from being in the classroom once a week. First, our teachers develop a true partnership with parents. Second, our children develop relationships with the parents they play with each week. Third, our parents develop friendships and have the opportunity to observe various approaches the teachers and other parents use. Fourth, it allows for our high adult to child ratio and the ability to offer activities we would not be able to do otherwise. Fifth, several dads help out in the classroom weekly, bimonthly, or occasionally. Obviously, children feel special when their parent stays to play and they get to arrive early to be the teacher’s special helper getting the classroom ready for the day. We really believe we are providing our children with the best preschool experience possible and weekly time in the classroom is a big part of that success.

                                General fundraising goals are set for each family to reach the collective goal. These are achieved through several fun and easy fundraising events and ongoing opportunities throughout the year. However, each family’s fundraising is not formally tracked by the school. We choose fundraisers that involve items many people would otherwise spend money on. Examples are the Chinook Book, SCRIP (gift cards to grocery and other stores), special dinners at neighborhood restaurants, and a very simple and elegant silent auction for adults only. Our largest fundraiser is a holiday wreath sale, again, something many people would ordinarily buy.

                                SWPCC’s goal is to keep our children as safe as possible and to make our teachers, parents and students aware of food-allergic children’s allergies and their consequences. Our policy is designed to reduce the chance of severe allergic reactions of children and adults with known food allergies while at Co-op.

                                We have a comprehensive allergy policy that includes teacher, parent, and child education regarding allergies, symptoms, and emergency responses. We do not allow food sharing during Co-op hours between children, teachers, and shift workers. We clean all surfaces where food is prepared and/or consumed prior to and after use. We wash children’s hands before eating, and have hands and faces wiped after eating food. We also require that parents of children with food allergies complete an “Allergy Action Plan”, which specifies symptoms of, and actions for, allergic reaction.
